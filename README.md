# TinyHLW8032
A new, customizable Arduino NMEA parsing library
A *NEW* Full-featured HLW8032 Parser for Arduino
TinyHLW8032 is a new Arduino library for parsing NMEA data streams provided by HLW8032 modules.

Like its predecessor, TinyHLW8032, this library provides compact and easy-to-use methods for extracting Voltage, Current, Power HLW8032 devices. 

However, TinyHLW8032â€™s programmer interface is considerably simpler to use than HLW8032, and the new library can extract arbitrary data from any of the myriad NMEA sentences out there, even proprietary ones.
